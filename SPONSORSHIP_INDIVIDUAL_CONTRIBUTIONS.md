# Sponsorship System Updates - Individual Contributions

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. **Separate User Contributions Per Profile**

- Each talent/event/team now tracks individual user contributions
- Uses localStorage with keys like `athlink-contribution-talent-1`, `athlink-contribution-event-4`, etc.
- No more shared contribution amounts across profiles

### 2. **Restored Sponsorship Checkpoints**

- Added back the sponsorship checkpoints section in the sidebar
- Shows package details with proper unlock status based on **user contribution** (not total funding)
- Visual indicators: Green for unlocked, Gray for locked

### 3. **Functional Contribution System**

- **Real contribution tracking**: When users contribute via modal, it updates their individual contribution for that profile
- **Persistent storage**: Contributions are saved to localStorage and restored on page load
- **Visual updates**: Progress bar and checkpoints update to reflect new contribution status

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**

- **Progress Bar**: Shows campaign progress + user's individual contribution thumb
- **Sponsorship Packages**: Detailed view of available packages with unlock status
