# Enhanced User Role System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Successfully enhanced the user authentication system to include **individual user roles** that are stored in the database and persist across sessions. Each authenticated user now has their own role that can be managed through the interface, while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing localStorage-based role system for non-authenticated users.

## Key Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ­ Database-Driven User Roles

- **Individual Roles**: Each user has their own role stored in the database
- **Persistent Storage**: Roles persist across browser sessions and devices
- **Auto-Assignment**: Existing users automatically assigned roles based on profile type
- **Role Management**: Users can update their roles through the interface

### ðŸ”„ Hybrid Role System

- **Authenticated Users**: Roles stored in database (primary)
- **Non-Authenticated Users**: Roles stored in localStorage (fallback)
- **Seamless Transition**: LocalStorage roles transition to database when user logs in
- **Real-time Updates**: Role changes immediately reflected in UI

## Database Schema Changes

### Added User Role Field

```sql
-- Added user_role field to User table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN user_role TEXT;
```

### Role Distribution

- **Talent**: 7 users (Athletes, Content Creators)
- **Team Leader**: 1 user (Basketball Team)
- **Event Leader**: 1 user (Swimming Championship)
- **Sponsor**: 0 users (available for assignment)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Integration

#### Schema Update

```prisma
model User {
  id                  Int               @id @default(autoincrement())
  name                String
  email               String            @unique
  password            String?
  user_role           String?           // New field for individual roles
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### Auto-Role Assignment

Created script to assign roles based on existing profile types:

- Users with `event_profile` â†’ **Event Leader**
- Users with `team_profile` â†’ **Team Leader**
- Users with `talent_profile` â†’ **Talent**
- Content creators â†’ **Talent**

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Get User Profile (Enhanced)

```typescript
GET /api/auth/user
Response: {
  user: {
    id: number,
    name: string,
    email: string,
    user_role: string,  // Individual user role
    // ... other fields
  },
  profile: { /* profile info */ }
}
```

#### Update User Role

```typescript
PATCH /api/auth/user/role
Body: { role: "Talent" | "Event Leader" | "Team Leader" | "Sponsor" }
Response: { success: boolean, user: { /* updated user */ } }
```

### 3. Enhanced Hooks

#### Updated `useAuth` Hook

```typescript
const {
  user,
  userRole, // Individual user's role from database
  isAuthenticated,
  // ... other properties
} = useAuth();
```

#### Enhanced `useUserRole` Hook

```typescript
const {
  selectedUserRole, // Current active role
  isAuthenticated, // Authentication status
  isUsingDatabaseRole, // True if using database role
  handleRoleSelect, // Works only for non-authenticated users
  // ... other properties
} = useUserRole();
```

### 4. UI Components

#### User Role Manager

- **Role Selection**: Dropdown with all available roles
- **Role Descriptions**: Clear explanations of each role
- **Update Functionality**: One-click role updates for authenticated users
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded role badges and success messages

#### Enhanced User Profile

- **Role Display**: Shows current user role as badge
- **Authentication Status**: Clear indication of login state
- **Profile Information**: Integrated with existing profile data

## Role Types & Descriptions

### Available Roles

```typescript
type UserRole = "Talent" | "Event Leader" | "Team Leader" | "Sponsor";
```

### Role Descriptions

- **Talent**: Individual athlete or performer seeking sponsorship opportunities
- **Event Leader**: Organizer of sports events, tournaments, or competitions
- **Team Leader**: Manager or captain of sports teams and athletic groups
- **Sponsor**: Brand or individual looking to sponsor athletic talent and events

### Role-Based Features

Each role enables different platform features:

- **Sponsorship System**: Different UI for sponsors vs talents
- **Profile Access**: Role-appropriate profile templates
- **Navigation**: Role-specific menu items and actions
- **Content Visibility**: Tailored content based on user role

## Testing the System

### Demo Interface

Visit `http://localhost:3000/demo` to test:

#### Test Accounts with Pre-Assigned Roles

```
Talents (Role: Talent):
- sarah.chen@example.com (Tennis)
- marcus.johnson@example.com (Basketball)
- emma.davis@example.com (Swimming)
- alex.rodriguez@example.com (Soccer)
- jake.thompson@example.com (Track & Field)
- sofia.martinez@example.com (Gymnastics)
- maya.patel@example.com (Content Creation)

Team Leader:
- team@thunderhawks.com (Basketball Team)

Event Leader:
- info@summerswim2024.com (Swimming Championship)

Password for all: 12345678
```

### Testing Workflow

1. **Visit Demo Page**: See current authentication status
2. **Login**: Use any test account with password `12345678`
3. **View Profile**: See auto-assigned role based on profile type
4. **Update Role**: Change role through the role manager
5. **Logout/Login**: Verify role persistence across sessions

## Integration Benefits

### 1. Sponsorship System Enhancement

- **Role-Based Access**: Sponsors see different UI than talents
- **Permission Control**: Only sponsors can create sponsorship offers
- **Targeted Features**: Role-appropriate functionality display

### 2. Profile System Integration

- **Auto-Detection**: User roles automatically determined from profiles
- **Consistency**: Role aligns with user's actual profile type
- **Flexibility**: Users can override auto-assigned roles if needed

### 3. Navigation & UI

- **Adaptive Interface**: UI adapts based on user role
- **Relevant Actions**: Show role-appropriate buttons and features
- **Better UX**: Users see features relevant to their role

## Migration Strategy

### Existing Users

- âœ… All 9 existing users automatically assigned appropriate roles
- âœ… Roles based on their profile types (talent/team/event)
- âœ… No data loss or breaking changes
- âœ… Seamless transition for existing functionality

### New Users

- ðŸ”„ New users will be prompted to select role during onboarding
- ðŸ”„ Role can be inferred from profile creation choices
- ðŸ”„ Default to "Talent" role with option to change

### Backward Compatibility

- âœ… LocalStorage role system still works for non-authenticated users
- âœ… Existing role-based features continue to function
- âœ… Smooth transition from localStorage to database roles

## Security & Data Integrity

### Role Validation

- **Server-Side Validation**: All role updates validated on backend
- **Enum Constraints**: Only valid roles accepted
- **User Ownership**: Users can only update their own roles

### Data Consistency

- **Database Storage**: Primary source of truth for authenticated users
- **Session Sync**: Role changes immediately reflected in session
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to localStorage on API errors

## Future Enhancements

### Role Hierarchy

- **Admin Roles**: Platform administrator roles
- **Permissions**: Granular permission system
- **Role Groups**: Multiple roles per user

### Advanced Features

- **Role History**: Track role changes over time
- **Role Suggestions**: AI-powered role recommendations
- **Bulk Operations**: Admin tools for role management

### Integration Opportunities

- **Event Registration**: Role-based event access
- **Messaging System**: Role-appropriate communication tools
- **Analytics**: Role-based usage analytics
